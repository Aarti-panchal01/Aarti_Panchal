# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Aarti

I'm a developer who loves experimenting with AI-assisted development tools to build, customize, and ship projects fast.

## ðŸš€ My AI Development Approach
I use tools like **Lovable** to quickly prototype front-end designs, then:
- Customize UI/UX to fit the vision
- Add & integrate APIs for dynamic data
- Optimize performance and deployment
- Deploy live using **Vercel** and other platforms

This lets me focus more on solving problems and delivering results â€” while still understanding the code inside-out.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Deployment:** Vercel, Netlify
- **Other Skills:** API integration, debugging, AI-assisted dev workflows

## ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
*(Pinned below)* â€“ Each project shows my process of using AI as a productivity boost, then customizing and deploying a fully functional application.

ðŸ’¡ *I believe AI isnâ€™t replacing developers â€” itâ€™s upgrading us. My projects are proof.*
